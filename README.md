# mesostructure_composition
Generate an AP/HTPB mesostructure assuming perfectly circular AP particles, given mean radius, standard deviation (normal distribution), and % composition. Analyze lines within the 2D image to draw relationships between those parameters and the probability of finding "interface".


in samples folders: 
for varying AP ratios:
the filenames are in the format of uni_AP4908_R50, which correlates to a unimodal distribution, AP ratio of 49.08%, and average particle radius of 50 um.
for varying radii:
the filenames are in the format of bi_R450um_AP5034, which correlates to a bimodal distribution, average fine particle radius of 45.0 um, and AP ratio of 50.34%. For a unimodal distribution, R450 would correspond to simply an overall average radius of the same value.
